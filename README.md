# Pokemon Quiz

# Project Overview

A quiz is a great way to test your knowledge on any given subject and is fun to play with or against others. Even today people still enjoy a simple quiz every now and then.

The purpose of this project is to provide a short but fun game for any pokemon fan. Novice or veteran as it houses very simple questions that most people could probably guess the answer to.

Having a scoreboard and a running timer gives a little competetive aspect to this quiz though allowing more people to come together to play it therefore increasing the potential user base.

- Provide a fun game to pass the time

# Game page

## Question section

The questions section will automatically display a question that is randomly picked for the user to answer. It Uses black font as to be easily interpreted and discernable by the user. Has a slightly larger text to add to this aswell. I decided the page would look too cluttered if I gave it a background so left it alone. The questions are inside of an array and are randomly selected using the Math.random() attribute.

## Answer's section

This box holds the different answer's that the user may pick from when making a decision. There are always three to choose from. The answers are inside of buttons that have been styled to have a white outline and a brown background as it fit's the color scheme and doesn't take away from the user's visual representation of the site. The correct answer will move randomly between these buttons so user's can't pick the same button for every question making an easy quiz.

## Score and Timer section's

These little boxes located at the bottom left and right of the page keep's track of the user's score out of /10 as well as the time talken to answer the questions. If the user is correct, the score will go up by 1, otherwise the score will remain the same. The timer will keep running until the final question has been answered. These boxes have the same style with a gold outline and brown background whilst the text inside remains black. This keeps everything readable and fair.
