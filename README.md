# Pokemon Quiz

# Project Overview

A quiz is a great way to test your knowledge on any given subject and is fun to play with or against others. Even today people still enjoy a simple quiz every now and then.

The purpose of this project is to provide a short but fun game for any pokemon fan. Novice or veteran as it houses very simple questions that most people could probably guess the answer to.

Having a scoreboard and a running timer gives a little competetive aspect to this quiz though allowing more people to come together to play it therefore increasing the potential user base.
